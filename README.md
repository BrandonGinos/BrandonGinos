<h3 align="center"><b> Hi, I'm Brandon! I'm a Data Analyst  ðŸ‘‹</b></h3>

<p align="center"> I began my journey with Data Science as a geologist who was thirsty for data, as in my opinion data is power </p>

<p align="center"> I am a highly motivated Data Analyst with skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau. I enjoy absorbing data and looking for trends and potentialcorelations where others just see numbers. I love Geology, Offroading, Being Outdoors absorbing nature. </p>
